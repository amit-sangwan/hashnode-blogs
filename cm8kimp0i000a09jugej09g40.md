## **ðŸš€ The Big Picture: What Are We Doing?**

In this blog, youâ€™ll walk through a **real-world Git workflow** designed for efficient branch management in collaborative projects. The goal is to **bring an outdated release branch in sync** with the latest production code, cleanly apply the changes, and push it to Gerrit for review.

---

## **ðŸ’¡ Thinking Like a Pro**

When working with Git, a **tech professionalâ€™s workflow** typically follows a logical and structured process. Hereâ€™s how youâ€™d naturally approach this in your day-to-day work:

1. **You realize your branch is outdated** â†’ Switch to your working branch.
    
2. **You ensure everything is in sync** â†’ Fetch and pull the latest changes.
    
3. **You apply production updates to your branch** â†’ Rebase it on top of `master`.
    
4. **You face conflicts (possibly)** â†’ Resolve them cleanly.
    
5. **You push the rebased branch** â†’ With force but safely.
    
6. **You verify everything works** â†’ Build and test your project.
    
7. **You merge it into** `master` â†’ Consolidate your branch into production.
    
8. **You push to Gerrit for review** â†’ Use the `ptg` alias for simplicity.
    
9. **You visualize and verify the history** â†’ Use Git logs and diffs to confirm everything.
    

âœ… This step-by-step flow reflects how **tech professionals** intuitively handle Git operations in real-world scenarios.

## **ðŸ”¥ Scenario 1: Real-World Scenario**

Imagine you're working on a project called `Automation`, which has the following branches:

* `master`: The **production-ready** branch with stable code.
    
* `r1`: A **release branch** containing new features in development.
    
* `r2` and `r3`: Release branches that have already been **merged into** `master`.
    

### **Current Situation**

* `r2` and `r3` have been merged into `master`, making it fully updated.
    
* However, `r1` still contains **unmerged features** and is now outdated compared to `master`.
    

### **Goal**

* **Bring** `r1` **up to date** with `master` by applying the latest production changes.
    
* **Rebase** `r1` **on** `master` for a cleaner and linear history.
    
* \*\*Merge `r1` into `master**` to include its new features.
    
* Use the `ptg` **alias** to automatically push the current branch to Gerrit for review.
    

---

### **ðŸ”¥ The Workflow â€“ Step by Step**

### **1\. Switch to the Release Branch**

The first step is to **switch to the working branch** (`r1`) where youâ€™ve been making changes.

```bash
git switch r1
```

**Why?**

* Ensures you are working on the correct branch.
    
* If `r1` doesnâ€™t exist locally, create it from remote:
    

```bash
git checkout -b r1 origin/r1
```

### **2\. Sync with the Remote Repository**

Before making any changes, **fetch the latest remote updates** to avoid conflicts.

```bash
git fetch origin       # Fetches the latest changes without merging  
git pull               # Syncs your local branch with the remote
```

**Why?**

* Keeps your local branch updated with the remote version.
    
* Prevents conflicts during rebasing.
    

### **3\. Rebase** `r1` **on Top of** `master`

Now, bring `r1` in sync by **rebasing it on top of** `master`. This applies the latest production changes over your current `r1` work, creating a clean and linear history.

```bash
git rebase origin/master
```

**Why?**

* **Rebase** applies your branch commits **on top of** `master`, keeping the history clean.
    
* It avoids unnecessary merge commits.
    

âœ… **Conflict Resolution During Rebase:**  
If you encounter a conflict:

```bash
git status               # Check conflicting files  
git add .                # Stage resolved files  
git rebase --continue    # Continue the rebase process
```

If you want to cancel the rebase:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

### **4\. Push the Rebasing Changes**

After a successful rebase, verify the status and **push the updated branch**.

```bash
git status                            # Verify current branch status  
git push origin r1 --force-with-lease  # Push rebased branch safely
```

**Why?**

* `--force-with-lease`:
    
    * Safer than `--force` because it only pushes if no one else has made changes.
        
    * Prevents accidental overwriting of remote changes.
        

### **5\. Build the Project**

Once the rebasing is complete, **build your project** to verify that everything works properly.

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests=true
```

**Why?**

* Ensures that your rebased code compiles and runs without issues.
    

### **6\. Switch to** `master` **and Pull the Latest Changes**

Before merging, make sure `master` is **up to date**.

```bash
git checkout master       # Switch to master  
git pull                  # Pull the latest changes
```

**Why?**

* Ensures youâ€™re merging into the latest `master` version.
    

### **7\. Merge** `r1` **into** `master`

Now, bring the `r1` features into `master`.

```bash
git merge --no-ff r1
```

**Why?**

* `--no-ff`:
    
    * Creates a **merge commit** even if a fast-forward is possible.
        
    * Preserves the branch history, making it easier to track.
        

### **8\. Visualize the Git History**

After merging, view the branch structure and commits to verify everything.

```bash
git log --all --graph --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --date=short
```

---

### **What Happens Internally with Rebase, Merge, Fetch, and Cherry-Pick?**

âœ… **Rebase:** Moves your branchâ€™s commits **on top of another branch** (like `master`), creating a cleaner and linear history.

âœ… **Merge:** Combines the history of two branches, creating a **merge commit** that contains both histories.

âœ… **Fetch:** Downloads the latest changes from the remote repository but **does not apply them** to your current branch.

âœ… **Cherry-Pick:** Selectively applies **specific commits** from one branch into another.

---

## **ðŸ”¥ Scenario 2: Cherry-Picking | Techie's Mindset: A Real-World Scenario**

Imagine you're working on the `r1` branch, and you realize that a **specific bug fix or feature** from the `r2` branch needs to be applied to `r1` without merging the entire `r2`.

### **The Process:**

1. **Identifies the Need:**
    
    * Notices that a recent commit in `r2` contains the bug fix they need.
        
    * Wants to bring **only that specific commit** to `r1` without merging the full branch.
        
2. **Fetches the Latest Changes:**
    

```bash
# On `r1` branch
# Fetch remote changes

git fetch origin
```

3. **Identifies the Commit to Cherry-Pick:**
    

```bash
# On `r1` branch
# Check log to find the commit hash from `r2`

git log origin/r2 --oneline
```

âœ… Finds the required commit hash (e.g., `abc123`).

4. **Cherry-Picks the Commit:**
    

```bash
# On `r1` branch
# Apply the specific commit from `r2`

git cherry-pick abc123
```

âœ… This brings the specific changes from `r2` into `r1`.

5. **Handles Potential Conflicts:**
    

* If conflicts arise, the tech pro resolves them manually:
    

```bash
# On `r1` branch
# Resolve conflicts

git status   # Identify conflicting files
# Manually resolve conflicts, then stage the changes

git add .

git cherry-pick --continue
```

6. **Verifies and Pushes:**
    

```bash
# On `r1` branch
# Verify and push changes

git status

git push origin r1
```

âœ… The specific bug fix or feature is now applied to `r1` without merging the full `r2` branch.

### **Some Answers To Some Questions:**

1. **What is the difference between** `git rebase` **and** `git merge`**?**
    
    * `merge`: Combines branches, preserving history.
        
    * `rebase`: Moves branch commits to the tip of another branch for a cleaner history.
        
2. **How do you resolve conflicts during a rebase?**
    
    * Use `git status` to identify conflicts.
        
    * Manually resolve conflicts, stage them, and continue with `git rebase --continue`.
        
3. **What is** `--force-with-lease`**, and why is it safer?**
    
    * It force-pushes only if no remote changes exist, preventing accidental overwrites.
        
4. **How do you revert a faulty merge or rebase?**
    
    * Use `git reset --hard HEAD~1` to undo a merge.
        
    * Use `git reflog` and `git reset` to revert a rebase.
        
5. **How do you squash multiple commits into one?**
    
    * Use `git rebase -i HEAD~<n>` and mark extra commits with `squash`.
