# What Are SAST, DAST, and SCA?

| Type | Full Form | What It Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SAST** | Static Application Security Testing | Scans your **source code** or binaries for security flaws **before the app runs** |
| **DAST** | Dynamic Application Security Testing | Tests the **running application** (usually in staging) for real vulnerabilities |
| **SCA** | Software Composition Analysis | Scans **dependencies** (open source libraries) for **known vulnerabilities (CVEs)** |

NOTE:: CVE, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a public catalog of known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures.

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Advantages of SAST:</strong>&nbsp;<br>Removes the need for manual checks, checking hundreds and thousands of lines of application source code on the flyShift left – identify defects in the codebase early in the SDLC and reduce fixing cost</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Disadvantage of SAST:</strong>&nbsp;<br>Requires access to source code and underlying framework, not suitable for COTS customization or outsourced developmentUnable to identify run time and environment-related issues – hard to determine the actual risks of security flaws and meaningful remediation</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## SAST – *Think: “White-box” code review*

* **Goal:** Identify issues like SQL Injection, XSS (Cross-site scripting), insecure crypto, hardcoded secrets
    
* **When:** Early (during coding/commit/build)
    
* **Scope:** Custom application code
    
* **Pros:** Fast feedback, shift-left, no need to run app
    
* **Cons:** False positives, no runtime context
    
* Tools: SonarQube
    

## DAST – *Think: “Black-box” penetration testing*

* **Goal:** Find exploitable vulnerabilities in the **deployed app**
    
* **When:** After deployment to test/staging
    
* **Scope:** HTTP endpoints, UI interactions
    
* **Pros:** Real-world vulnerability detection
    
* **Cons:** No code visibility, can miss logic flaws, slow
    
* Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite (Pro) etc.
    

## SCA – *Think: “Dependency health checker”*

* **Goal:** Find CVEs in your third-party packages (NPM, Maven, pip, etc.)
    
* **When:** During build (or even pre-commit)
    
* **Scope:** Dependency manifests like `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `requirements.txt`
    
* **Pros:** Fast, covers (Open Source Softwares) OSS risks, license checking
    
* **Cons:** May miss deeply nested/transitive issues
    

**Security Development Life Cycle (SecSDLC or SDL):**  
An extension of SDLC that integrates security practices throughout every phase to build software that is secure by design, minimizing vulnerabilities and risks.

### Phases Comparison Table

| **SDLC Phase** | **Purpose** | **SecSDLC Phase** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements | Gather functional requirements | Security Requirements | Define security needs & compliance |
| Design | Create software architecture | Threat Modeling & Secure Design | Identify threats, design secure system |
| Implementation | Code development | Secure Coding & SAST (Snyk and sonarqube) | Write secure code, perform static scans |
| Testing | Functional & integration testing | Security Testing (DAST, Pen Test) (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) | Dynamic scanning & vulnerability testing |
| Deployment | Release to production | Secure Deployment & Configuration | Apply secure configs, scan IaC & containers |
| Maintenance | Bug fixes & updates | Continuous Monitoring & Patch Management | Monitor security posture & patch vulnerabilities |

# How to Embed SAST, SCA, and DAST into CI/CD

A\[Code Commit\] --&gt; B\[SAST & SCA Scans \]  
B --&gt; C\[Build & Run Unit Tests\]

C --&gt; D\[Deploy to Staging\]

D --&gt; E\[DAST Scan (Dynamic Application Testing)\]

E --&gt; F\[Security Gate Check (Policies, CVE Threshold, License Check)\]

F --&gt; G\[Deploy to Production\]

### DevSecOps Pipeline Security Steps

| Step | Stage | Description & Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Code Commit | Code pushed triggers automated scans. |
| B | SAST & SCA | Static code & dependency scans for vulnerabilities.  
Tools: Snyk,sonarqube |
| C | Build & Unit Tests | Compile code and run unit tests. |
| D | Deploy to Staging | Deploy app to staging for testing. |
| E | DAST Scan | Dynamic scans for runtime vulnerabilities.  
Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite |
| F | Security Gate | Enforce security policies; block risky deployments. |

**Some Other Tools:**

#### **Snyk**

* **NOT a pure SAST or DAST tool**, but a **Developer-first Security Platform**.
    
* **At its core, Snyk is an SCA tool**, but it has expanded into a **DevSecOps platform** by offering::
    
    * SCA (Software Composition Analysis) → scans open-source dependencies (like in `package.json`, `pom.xml`, etc.)
        
    * Container security (Docker image scanning)
        
    * IaC ( Infrastructure as Code ) scanning (Terraform, Kubernetes YAMLs)
        
    * Partial SAST Capabilities (with Snyk Code)
        

#### Zscaler – Cloud Security Platform (Zero Trust)

* A **cloud-based secure gateway** that protects users and workloads on the internet and internal apps.
    
* **When it's used:**  
    In **network-level security**, protecting users, endpoints, and cloud environments.
    
    **What it does:**
    
    * Enforces **Zero Trust Access** (ZTNA)
        
    * Protects users from malware, phishing, malicious content
        
    * Secures outbound internet access (SWG, Cloud Firewall)
        
    * DLP (Data Loss Prevention)
        
    
    **Benefits:**
    
    * Prevents **data breaches and malware**
        
    * **Secures remote access** without a VPN
        
    * Ensures **least privilege access**
        

#### Okta – Identity & Access Management (IAM)

* A secure **identity provider** that manages **authentication** and **authorization** across apps and APIs.
    
* **When it's used:**  
    Across the entire SDLC — both during development (auth integration) and production (access enforcement).
    
* **What it offers:**
    
    * OAuth2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC)
        
    * SSO (Single Sign-On)
        
    * MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
        
    * RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
        
    
    **Benefits:**
    
    * Prevents **account takeovers**
        
    * Enforces **secure login policies**
