> ### *A Software Security Maturity Model is a structured framework that helps organizations assess, improve, and scale their software security practices across the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).*

---

### Popular Software Security Maturity Models:

* **OWASP SAMM** is a **framework** to help organizations evaluate and improve their **software security posture**. It provides a **structured roadmap** for implementing secure software practices.
    
* **DSOMM** is a maturity model specifically designed for **DevSecOps** teams. It helps assess how security is integrated into **development pipelines**, tooling, automation, and DevOps culture.
    
    *(It’s more* ***engineering-focused*** *compared to SAMM.)*

### Software Assurance Maturity Model ( SAMM )

SAMM gives a structured way to assess and mature software security practices across the entire SDLC — from governance and design to deployment and incident response

SAMM is organized into **5 Business Functions ( Dimensions )** , each with **2 Security Practices ( Sub-dimentsions )**, and each practice has **3 maturity levels**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1168/0*W6i_vAvAfssffTw3 align="left")

| Dimensions | Sub-Dimensions |
| --- | --- |
| **Governance** | Strategy & Metrics, Policy & Compliance |
| **Design** | Threat Assessment, Security Requirements |
| **Implementation** | Secure Architecture, Secure Build |
| **Verification** | Security Testing, Code Review |
| **Operations** | Environment Management, Incident Management |

Each practice is assessed at **Maturity Levels 1 to 3**:

* **Level 1**: Ad-hoc or minimal process
    
* **Level 2**: Defined and repeatable process
    
* **Level 3**: Optimized, integrated, and measurable
    

**Benefits:**

* Enables organizations to improve their security posture incrementally. 
    
* Allows for customization to fit different organizational needs. 
    
* Facilitates a more secure software development process.

### DevSecOps Maturity Model ( DSOMM)

DSOMM is a technical maturity model focused on how well security is baked into DevOps pipelines. We used it to assess areas like secret management, automated SAST/DAST, and IaC security.

It is specifically designed for **DevSecOps** teams to assess how security is integrated into **development pipelines**, tooling, automation, and DevOps culture

DSOMM is structured as a **matrix** of categories and maturity levels. Examples of categories:

Each is ranked on a **maturity scale from 0–3 or 0–5**, depending on implementation depth:

* **0**: Not implemented / Basic understanding of security practices
    
* **1**: Manual or inconsistent / Adoption Of basic security practices
    
* **2**: Semi-automated or defined / High adoption of security practices
    
* **3**: Fully automated and monitored / Advance deployment of security practices

![What is the DevSecOps Maturity Model (DSOMM)? - Spectral](https://spectralops.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DevSecOps-Maturity-Model-degress-of-implementation.png align="right")

---

| Feature | **SAMM** | **DSOMM** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Focus | Holistic SDLC security | Engineering/DevOps automation focus |
| Created by | OWASP | OWASP DevSecOps Team |
| Categories | 5 Business Functions (Governance to Ops) | DevSecOps-centric areas (SAST, SCA, IaC, Secrets) |
| Target Users | CISOs, Security Architects, AppSec | DevSecOps engineers, platform/security leads |
| Output | Strategic roadmap | Tactical improvements in tooling/process |

---

Depending on the org’s maturity, OWASP SAMM can align business and security goals with DevSecOps practices. Combining both gives a complete picture — strategic and operational — to grow secure software delivery capabilities.

For Example, a customised maturity model can have dimensions like:

* **Organization, Governance & Culture** ( Focuses on **people, leadership, and mindset**.  
    Security is everyone's responsibility — from CISO to developer. Strong governance means clear policies, training, and a culture of secure development.)
    
* **Implementation (Design, Code, IaC)** Focuses on **secure design and development**.  
    Includes secure coding, threat modeling, and scanning infrastructure-as-code (like Terraform). Goal: “Secure by design” before code even runs.
    
* **Build & Deployment** Focuses on **security in CI/CD pipelines**.  
    Includes SAST, dependency scanning, artifact signing, and container/image security. Ensures that only verified, secure code is deployed.
    
* **Test & Verification** Focuses on **validating security controls**.  
    Includes dynamic testing (DAST), pen testing, fuzzing, and verifying access controls and logging. It's about finding what slipped through the cracks.
    
* **Information Gathering** Focuses on **visibility, feedback, and monitoring**.  
    Central logging, alerting, SIEM integration, vulnerability dashboards, and security metrics — all to inform and improve the next cycle.

### Benefits of Using a Maturity Modal:

* Provides a **clear roadmap** for improving security
    
* Helps align **security with business and dev goals**
    
* Enables **gap analysis** across teams or departments
    
* Supports **compliance**, **risk reduction**, and **trust**
