### **How Websites Work**

When you visit a website, the request flows through multiple layers:  
**Client ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Server**

* **Client:** Your device (laptop, phone) sends a request with its **IP address**.
    
* **Network:** Routers, switches, and DNS servers direct the request through the internet.
    
* **Server:** Processes the request and sends the website data back to the client.
    

üí° **Example:** Netflix (built on AWS) delivers content globally using AWS servers.

### **What is Cloud Computing?**

Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery** of IT resources with **pay-as-you-go pricing**.

* **Compute power**, database storage, and applications on demand.
    
* **Scalability:** Instantly access more resources when needed.
    
* **AWS Infrastructure:** AWS owns and maintains the **network-connected hardware** for these services.
    

**Key Benefits:**

* No need to own hardware.
    
* Access resources instantly.
    
* Only pay for what you use.
    

---

### **Cloud Deployment Models**

1. **üåê Public Cloud:**
    
    * Resources owned by **third-party providers** (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
        
    * Delivered over the internet.
        
    * **Example:** Hosting apps on AWS servers.
        
2. **üîí Private Cloud:**
    
    * Used by a **single organization**, offering better control and security.
        
    * Ideal for sensitive data.
        
3. **üîó Hybrid Cloud:**
    
    * **Combines on-premises infrastructure** with cloud resources.
        
    * Used to protect sensitive data while leveraging cloud benefits.
        
    * **Example:** Banks using on-prem for sensitive data and cloud for customer services.

### **AWS Cloud Use Cases**

AWS enables you to build sophisticated, **scalable applications** across industries:

* **Enterprise IT:** Backup, storage, big data analytics.
    
* **Web Hosting:** Websites, mobile, and social apps.
    
* **Gaming:** Build and scale game servers with ease.
    

üí° **Example:** Netflix uses AWS for reliable, scalable content delivery.

### **AWS Global Infrastructure**

AWS is spread globally for **high availability** and low latency.

**AWS Regions:**

* Clusters of data centers worldwide.
    
* Named like `us-east-1`, `eu-west-3`.
    
* Most AWS services are region-scoped.
    
* **How to choose a region:**
    
    * **Compliance:** Data governance regulations.
        
    * **Proximity:** Reduced latency for nearby users.
        
    * **Service Availability:** New services may be region-specific.
        
    * **Pricing:** Costs vary by region.
        

**Availability Zones (AZ):**

* Each region has **3-6 AZs** (usually 3).
    
* Each AZ consists of multiple data centers with:
    
    * **Redundant power**
        
    * **Networking and connectivity**
        
* Isolated from disasters but interconnected with **low-latency networks**.
    

**Point of Presence (PoP):**

* **400+ PoPs** across 90+ countries.
    
* Improves content delivery speeds (via CloudFront CDN).

### **AWS Global and Region-Scoped Services**

**Global Services:**

* **IAM:** Identity and Access Management.
    
* **Route 53:** DNS service.
    
* **CloudFront:** Content delivery network.
    
* **WAF:** Web Application Firewall.
    

**Region-Scoped Services:**

* **EC2:** Infrastructure as a Service.
    
* **Elastic Beanstalk:** Platform as a Service.
    
* **Lambda:** Function as a Service.
    
* **Rekognition:** Software as a Service.

### **AWS Pricing Model**

AWS uses a **pay-as-you-go** pricing structure with three main categories:

1. **üíª Compute:**
    
    * Pay for the time your EC2 instances run.
        
    * Billing stops when instances are terminated.
        
2. **üì¶ Storage:**
    
    * Pay for the data you store (e.g., S3 buckets).
        
3. **üîó Data Transfer:**
    
    * **IN ‚Üí** Free.
        
    * **OUT ‚Üí** Charged based on region and amount of data.
        

**Cost Benefits:**

* **Lower TCO:** No upfront hardware costs.
    
* **Massive economies of scale:** AWS reduces prices as it grows more efficient.
    
* **Flexible scaling:** Only pay for what you use.

### **Additional Key AWS Concepts**

**Elasticity vs. Scalability:**

* **Elasticity:** Automatically adds or removes resources based on demand.
    
    * Example: Auto-scaling EC2 instances.
        
* **Scalability:** Increases or decreases resources **manually**.
    
    * Example: Adding more EC2 instances as traffic grows.
        

**High Availability (HA) vs. Fault Tolerance (FT):**

* **High Availability:** Ensures minimal downtime by using redundant systems.
    
    * Example: Multi-AZ deployments.
        
* **Fault Tolerance:** Automatically recovers from failures without service interruption.
    
    * Example: S3 with cross-region replication.
        

**AWS Support Plans:**

1. **Basic:** Free, includes customer service and community forums.
    
2. **Developer:** For experimenting or testing environments.
    
3. **Business:** For production workloads, 24/7 support.
    
4. **Enterprise:** For mission-critical workloads, dedicated TAM support.
    

**AWS Well-Architected Framework:**

* **Operational Excellence:** Efficiently run and monitor systems.
    
* **Security:** Protect systems and information.
    
* **Reliability:** Recover quickly from failures.
    
* **Performance Efficiency:** Use resources efficiently.
    
* **Cost Optimization:** Reduce unnecessary costs.

### **Shared Responsibility Model**

AWS uses a **shared responsibility model** for security and compliance:

**AWS Responsibility (Security of the Cloud):**

* Protecting the infrastructure.
    
* Managing the physical security of hardware.
    
* Securing services like S3, EC2, and RDS.
    

**Customer Responsibility (Security in the Cloud):**

* Managing access control (IAM).
    
* Encrypting sensitive data.
    
* Configuring security groups and firewalls.
    
* Patching OS and applications.
    

üí° **Example:**

* AWS protects the **data centers**, while you configure IAM roles and security groups.
