### Let’s imagine we’re building a **SaaS web application** with the following components:

| **Component** | **Technology Stack** | **Responsibility** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | React / Next.js | UI for users to interact with the app |
| **API Gateway** | NGINX or AWS API Gateway | Entry point, routing, security |
| **Auth Service** | OAuth2, JWT | Authentication and token issuance |
| **User Service** | Node.js / Python / Go | Handles user profile management |
| **Order Service** | Node.js / Python / Go | Handles customer orders |
| **Payment Service** | Stripe API | Integrates with external payment systems |
| **Databases** | PostgreSQL (Users), MongoDB (Orders) | Data persistence per service |
| **Queue** | RabbitMQ or Kafka | Asynchronous order processing |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK | Observability and log management |
| **Secrets Store** | HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager | Secure secrets and key storage |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions + Kubernetes | Automation for build, deploy, release |

All services are containerized using **Docker**, orchestrated via **Kubernetes**, and deployed with **GitHub Actions** CI/CD pipelines.

## What Are We Building? – Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

To start, we model our system using a **Level 1 Data Flow Diagram** (DFD) to visualize the flow of data between various components.

### DFD Elements

* **Entities:**
    
    * Users (via browser or mobile)
        
    * External Payment Provider (Stripe)
        
* **Processes:**
    
    * API Gateway
        
    * Frontend App
        
    * Auth, User, Order, Payment Services
        
* **Data Stores:**
    
    * PostgreSQL (User DB)
        
    * MongoDB (Orders DB)
        
    * Secrets Store (Vault)
        
* **Trust Boundaries:**
    
    * Internet → Gateway
        
    * Gateway → Microservices
        
    * Microservices → DBs/Queues
        
    * CI/CD → Cluster
        

### Data Flows

1. User → API Gateway (Login, Place Order)
    
2. API Gateway → Auth Service (Token Verification)
    
3. API Gateway → User Service (User Profile)
    
4. API Gateway → Order Service (Order Creation)
    
5. Order Service → Payment Provider (Charge via Stripe)
    
6. Order Service → Message Queue (Emit Order Event)
    
7. Services ↔ Databases
    
8. CI/CD → Kubernetes Cluster
    

> **Tools**: OWASP Threat Dragon, Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (TMT), [draw.io](http://draw.io), or `pytm` for code-based DFDs.

## Step 2: What Can Go Wrong? – STRIDE Threat Modeling

We apply the **STRIDE** model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to each key component.

---

### Example: API Gateway

| STRIDE Category | Threat | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Spoofing** | Attacker impersonates service | Mutual TLS, JWT validation |
| **Tampering** | API parameters modified in transit | Enforce HTTPS, input validation |
| **Repudiation** | Logs are missing | Centralized logging with signed logs |
| **Information Disclosure** | Sensitive data in error responses | Data classification, limit over-fetching |
| **DoS** | Flood API with requests | WAF, rate limiting, caching |
| **EoP** | Missing auth header allows escalation | Enforce OAuth2, strict AuthN at gateway |

---

### Example: Payment Service

| STRIDE Category | Threat | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Spoofing** | Faked payment callbacks | Validate Stripe signatures |
| **Tampering** | Modify order amounts | Validate against DB values |
| **Info Disclosure** | Log payment data | Don’t log tokens or sensitive payloads |
| **DoS** | Infinite payment retry loop | Circuit breakers, exponential backoff |

### Example: Databases: SQLi, leaked credentials

| STRIDE Category | Threat | Explanation | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Spoofing** | Attacker uses stolen DB credentials to impersonate a legitimate user | Unauthorized access using leaked DB credentials | Enforce strong authentication (e.g., IAM roles, multi-factor), rotate credentials regularly |
| **Tampering** | SQL Injection alters database queries to manipulate data | Injection of malicious SQL to read/modify/delete data | Use parameterized queries/prepared statements, input validation, ORM usage |
| **Repudiation** | Malicious DB users deny unauthorized changes | Lack of audit logs or tamper-proof logging | Enable detailed audit logging, immutable logs, monitoring suspicious DB activities |
| **Information Disclosure** | Sensitive data leaked through injection or improper access | Unauthorized exposure of PII, credentials, business data | Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit, restrict query results, least privilege access |
| **Denial of Service** | DB overwhelmed by heavy queries or injection causing crashes | Attackers degrade DB availability | Rate limit queries, use query timeout limits, monitor query performance, isolate DB resources |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Exploit injection or misconfiguration to gain higher DB privileges | Attackers escalate access to admin or system roles | Harden DB permissions, avoid running DB as superuser, apply patches and security updates |

---

### Repeat for all major components:

* **Frontend**: CSRF, script injection, session theft
    
* **Auth Service**: Token spoofing, weak JWT signing
    
* **User Service**: IDOR, insecure direct access
    
* **Order Service**: Business logic flaws
    
* **Databases**: SQLi, leaked credentials
    
* **Queues**: Message spoofing, flooding
    
* **Secrets Store**: Misconfigured access policies
    
* **CI/CD**: Supply chain attacks, exposed secrets
    

---

## Step 3: What Are We Doing About It? – Mitigations & Controls

We now map each threat to actionable security controls and tools:

| Threat | Mitigation | Tool/Control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JWT Replay Attack | Use short TTL, rotate signing keys | Auth0, Keycloak |
| Sensitive Data Exposure | Mask PII in logs | ELK Stack, Datadog |
| Broken Authentication | Enforce RBAC | OPA, Gatekeeper |
| Secrets Leakage | Externalize secrets, audit access | HashiCorp Vault, IAM |
| API Abuse | Rate limiting at gateway | Kong, AWS WAF, NGINX |

### Integrate into DevSecOps pipeline:

* **SAST / DAST / SCA**
    
* **IaC Scanning** – `tfsec`, `checkov`
    
* **API Schema Validation** – OpenAPI spec enforcement
    
* **Secrets Scanning** – `truffleHog`, `gitleaks`
    

---

## Step 4: Did We Do a Good Job?

Post-modeling, we evaluate and integrate:

* **Peer Review** the threat model
    
* **Test Mapping** – Turn threats into security test cases
    
* **Backlog Integration** – Track in JIRA or GitHub Projects
    
* **Model Drift Detection** – Update threat models over time
    

---

## DevSecOps Integration: When & Where?

| Dev Stage | Security Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Design** | Threat model per feature |
| **Develop** | Write abuse test cases |
| **Build** | Enforce OPA/Kyverno policies |
| **Test** | Pen-test high-risk components |
| **Deploy** | CI/CD gate on threat model updates |
| **Operate** | Monitor logs, alerts, anomalies |

## Threat Modeling for APIs

---

### 1\. Understand the API Architecture and Workflow

Identify:

* API Gateway or Proxy
    
* Clients (web, mobile, other services)
    
* Backend microservices
    
* Datastores (DB, cache)
    
* Auth mechanisms (OAuth2, JWT, API keys)
    
* External dependencies (3rd party APIs)
    

### 2\. Identify Threats Using STRIDE

| STRIDE | API-Specific Threats | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S | API key or JWT token theft | Impersonation |
| T | Modify request payload | Malicious inputs |
| R | Lack of traceability | No logs or tampered logs |
| I | Sensitive data in responses | PII exposed in JSON |
| D | Endpoint flooding | Bot attacks |
| E | Privilege escalation | Access to admin routes |

### 3\. Analyze API Threats

| API Endpoint | Threat | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /login | Brute force | CAPTCHA, lockouts, rate limit |
| /user/{id} | Info disclosure | AuthZ checks, data filtering |
| /order POST | Tampering | Validate schema, logic checks |

### 4\. Controls & Tools

| Threat | Control | Tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JWT theft | Short TTL, rotate | Keycloak, Auth0 |
| Input tampering | Schema validation | OpenAPI, JSON Schema |
| Sensitive data | Masking, encryption | Vault, TLS, ELK |
| DoS | Rate limiting | Kong, AWS WAF |

### 5\. Integrate in DevSecOps

* **Design**: Threat model per API
    
* **Develop**: Use secure coding and schema enforcement
    
* **Build/Test**: SAST/DAST/API tests
    
* **Deploy**: Gate on test coverage, use secrets management
    
* **Operate**: API observability and alerts
    

---

### Sample Table: Threat Summary

| Component | Threat | Risk | Control | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API Gateway | DoS | High | Rate limiting | DevOps |
| Payment Service | Spoofed callbacks | High | Signature check | Backend |
| Order Service | Broken auth | Critical | RBAC, JWT checks | Security |
| Vault | Secrets exposure | Critical | IAM, Audit Logs | Platform |

## Conclusion

Threat modeling isn't a one-time activity—it’s a continuous process. By integrating DFDs, STRIDE, and mitigations early in the DevSecOps pipeline, we can **proactively identify, track, and mitigate threats** in any modern microservices-based SaaS environment.
