The 2025 edition of the CrowdStrike Global Threat Report paints a clear and urgent picture: threat actors have become faster, stealthier, and increasingly business-like.

The focus has shifted from malware-heavy tactics to **malware-free intrusions**, **identity abuse**, **social engineering**, and **AI-assisted operations**.

## Key Trends and What They Mean for Defenders

### 1\. Adversaries Are Operating Faster Than Ever

* **Breakout time** (time from initial access to lateral movement) dropped to an average of **48 minutes**, with the fastest observed at **51 seconds**.
    
* **Implication**: Defenders now have **less than an hour to detect and respond** before attackers pivot to critical assets.
    
* **Recommended Action**: Implement real-time threat detection and response, especially for endpoints and identity systems.

### 2\. Social Engineering Becomes the Preferred Initial Access Method

* **Vishing (voice phishing)** attacks grew **442%** in the second half of 2024.
    
* Campaigns used a combination of spam bombing, impersonation, and remote access tools like **Quick Assist** or **TeamViewer**.
    
* **Case Insight**: CURLY SPIDER used social engineering to gain control within **4 minutes** of engagement.
    
* **Recommended Action**:
    
    * Train employees and help desk staff on **vishing indicators**.
        
    * Establish strict **identity verification protocols** for phone-based requests.
        
    * Enforce **just-in-time remote access** policies.
        

---

### 3\. AI Is Helping Hackers

* Criminals are now using **generative AI** (like ChatGPT) to write phishing emails, create fake identities, and even clone voices and faces.
    
* AI-generated scam emails are more convincing — people are 4x more likely to click on them compared to human-written ones.
    

**What to do:**  
Review and upgrade your spam filters, and educate employees about AI-generated scams. Use tools that detect unusual email patterns.

---

### 4\. Hackers Are Avoiding Malware

* In 2024, **79% of attacks didn’t use traditional malware**. Instead, attackers use stolen passwords and legitimate tools to sneak in quietly.
    
* They use remote monitoring tools or cloud access that looks like regular user activity.
    

**What to do:**  
Focus on securing user accounts with **strong multi-factor authentication (MFA)** and watch for **unusual login behavior**.

---

### 5\. Cloud Systems Are Being Targeted

* Hackers are targeting cloud accounts — like Microsoft 365, AWS, or Google Cloud — by stealing login details.
    
* They also use weak security settings or shared access between companies to sneak in.
    
* One-third of cloud attacks in early 2024 started with a stolen valid account.
    

**What to do:**  
Regularly check cloud user permissions, enforce strong passwords, and monitor for logins from unusual locations or devices.

---

### 6\. Security Gaps in Devices and Software Are Still a Big Risk

* Attackers are using known security flaws in routers, firewalls, and software to get in — especially if the devices are exposed to the internet.
    
* Sometimes, they combine two or more vulnerabilities to break in more easily (called **exploit chaining**).
    

**What to do:**  
Keep all systems updated — especially anything that’s internet-facing like VPNs, firewalls, and cloud tools.

---

### 7\. Insider Threats Are Becoming More Sophisticated

* Some attackers get hired as fake employees (especially developers), then use company laptops to steal data or open backdoors.
    
* One North Korea-linked group used fake LinkedIn profiles and AI-written resumes to land jobs.
    

**What to do:**  
Tightly control who can install software or access sensitive systems. Watch for unusual work patterns — especially from remote workers.

## Strategic Takeaways for 2025

1. **Speed matters**: Detection and response cycles must be measured in seconds, not hours.
    
2. **Identity is the new perimeter**: Secure and monitor user and machine identities like critical infrastructure.
    
3. **Assume compromise**: Focus on containment, lateral movement prevention, and blast radius control.
    
4. **AI cuts both ways**: Use it to detect, anticipate, and respond — just like adversaries do.
